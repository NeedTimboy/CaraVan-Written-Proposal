# CaraVan — Written Proposal

## The Problem

The van-life community is one of the fastest-growing lifestyle movements in the United States, yet its members remain scattered across generic social platforms that were never designed for life on the road. Vanlifers currently juggle multiple apps to meet basic needs: Instagram for community, Tinder for dating, Facebook Groups for meetups, YouTube for build advice, and Google Maps for route planning. None of these platforms understand the unique challenges of mobile living — finding nearby community members, coordinating spontaneous meetups at remote locations, dating within a shared lifestyle, or learning how to wire a solar system into a converted Sprinter van.

This fragmentation creates real friction. Meetups get buried in Facebook threads. Dating apps surface people who don't understand the lifestyle. Build advice is scattered across dozens of YouTube channels with no way to ask follow-up questions. There is no single platform where vanlifers can find their people, plan their next adventure, learn to build their home on wheels, and meet someone who shares the road.

## Target Audience

CaraVan is built for the North American van-life community, which spans a broad demographic united by a shared lifestyle rather than age, income, or geography.

**Primary users include:**

- **Full-time vanlifers** (ages 22–45) who live and travel in converted vans, buses, or RVs year-round and need consistent access to community, events, and resources wherever they are parked.
- **Weekend warriors and aspiring vanlifers** (ages 25–50) who are building out their first van or planning a transition to mobile living and need build guidance and community connection.
- **Solo travelers** seeking safety in numbers — people who want to find trusted community members nearby for caravanning, shared campsites, or simply knowing someone is parked nearby.

The van-life community values authenticity, self-reliance, and shared experience. CaraVan reflects these values by combining practical tools (maps, build guides, event coordination) with genuine social connection (a curated feed, lifestyle-specific dating, and direct messaging) in a single, purpose-built platform.

## The Solution

CaraVan is a native Android application that brings five core experiences together under one roof:

1. **Social Feed** — A community-driven feed where members share stories, photos, and videos from the road. Features include post privacy controls, @mentions, and an "Active Members Nearby" carousel powered by device geolocation.

2. **Activities & Events** — An interactive Google Maps view with custom emoji markers for 12 activity types (hiking, surfing, climbing, camping, and more), paired with a calendar view for planning. Members can create events, set capacity limits, and RSVP — making spontaneous meetups as easy as tapping a pin.

3. **Dating** — A swipe-based dating experience designed for people who live on the road. Preference filtering includes intentions, interests, location radius, and age range. Safety tips and an invite-only tier ensure trust within the community.

4. **Build Guides** — A categorized library of van build content covering electrical, plumbing, insulation, solar, flooring, roofing, and furniture. Free users access introductory guides, while premium subscribers unlock the full library and a direct "Ask a Builder" Q&A feature.

5. **Profile & Account** — Rich user profiles with van photos, activity interests, follower networks, and van icon badges that celebrate the diversity of builds on the road.

## Monetization Strategy

CaraVan uses a freemium subscription model powered by RevenueCat and billed through Google Play.

**Free Tier** — Full access to the social feed, map and calendar, basic dating (with daily swipe limits), messaging, and two introductory build guides. The free tier delivers meaningful value to ensure adoption and community growth.

**FastTrack Subscription — $9.99/month** — Unlocks the complete premium experience:

| Feature | Free | FastTrack |
|---------|------|-----------|
| Unlimited Swipes | — | Yes |
| See Who Liked You | — | Yes |
| Build Guides | 2 Free | All 10+ |
| Ask a Builder Q&A | — | Yes |
| Priority Matching | — | Yes |
| Ad-Free Experience | — | Yes |

The $9.99 price point is positioned competitively below mainstream dating apps (Tinder Plus at $14.99, Bumble Premium at $19.99) while offering significantly more functionality — social networking, event planning, and educational content in addition to dating.

**Revenue projections scale with community size.** At 5,000 monthly active users with a 5% conversion rate, FastTrack generates approximately $2,500/month in recurring revenue. At 50,000 users with the same conversion rate, that grows to $25,000/month. As the build guide library and builder Q&A network expand, conversion rates are expected to increase as premium content becomes the primary reason new users subscribe.

**Future monetization opportunities** include featured event listings for van-life businesses, sponsored build guide partnerships with parts suppliers, and a marketplace for van sales — each extending revenue without compromising the core user experience.

## Summary

CaraVan solves a real fragmentation problem for a passionate, growing community. By uniting social connection, event coordination, lifestyle-specific dating, and educational content into a single native Android app, CaraVan becomes the home base for life on the road. The FastTrack subscription provides a sustainable revenue model that grows with the community while keeping the core experience free and accessible.
